    <!-- Stuff about videos -->
    <p>
        As someone who almost exclusively uses dark themes for my browsers, IDEs, and word processing programs, I wanted
        to integrate a dark theme into my blog. I started looking at implementations such as the theme switcher
        references below but wanted to stick to a simpler approach. I started by changing the background color and
        finding appropriate font colors to make sure the text was still legible. After finding a color that I liked, I
        applied it to all of my headers and anchors for a cohesive theme. I then looked into finding a unique font from
        Google fonts and imported that as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        After changing the color scheme and fonts I needed to redo the style of my code snippets. I found a template to
        start from on StackOverflow and altered the size and color scheme to match the page. Originally, I was going to
        add line numbers as well, but I was not able to get that working.

    <h1>Blog Post 1</h1>
    <!-- Stuff about videos -->
    <p>I watched some videos regarding the uses of CSS and how to make web pages more stylish. I knew basic knowledge
        about building a website through services like Squarespace, but I didn't know what code was being used on a more
        basic level. Prior to this course I could probably read HTML and understand the basic concepts behind it but
        didn't know about the uses of anchors and the different forms of ordered and unordered lists.
        While making this post I also learned about how to encode sample HTML code to have it display correctly. I used
        an online encoder and pasted raw HTML into the converter so I was able to have it display as raw text rather
        than being interpreted as code. Finally, I read about adding pictures via their link and resizing them to fit
        the structure of the page. </p>
    <!-- Sample code -->
    <h2>Sample code:</h2>
    <pre>
    <code> Sample of anchors:
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:m.bluth@example.com"&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="tel:+123456789"&gt;Phone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
    </code>

    <h1>Blog Post 5</h1>
    <h3>Imagine that you are teaching CS 347 in Spring 2022. How would you design your version of the course? What would you
    have the students do? What helped you learn the material of this course and what do you think would help your
    students learn?</h3>
    <h3>Course Cadence:</h3><p>If I could change the structure of future sections of CS347, I would mostly alter the amount of time spent on
    HTML/CSS vs. JavaScript and how they were introduced. Since HTML and CSS are simpler than JavaScript, there should
    be much more time spent on JavaScript. I feel like we spent weeks on HTML and CSS to the point that it was boring,
    then plain JavaScript, JSX, Node, React, Nginx, and pm2 were dumped on us very quickly. Although this responsibility
    falls on me, I definitely am not confident in my JavaScript skills at this point.
    An idea I had was to introduce JavaScript first (rather than HTML) and switch the course cadence to where JS gets
    the amount of time HTML currently does. I would draw comparisons between Java and JavaScript and start with sample
    files that are partially completed to the point where students can create some sort of output. Then slowly introduce
    JSX, Node, and React.</p>
    <h3>Labs:</h3><p>I would also eliminate non-vital labs and add more starter code to most of them so that labs can realistically be
    finished in class. Even if current students are not expected to complete labs as homework, if students’ labs are
    unfinished, that means that students have less to start from when working on projects. Making labs shorter also
    allows students to ask for help in class about the entire scope of the lab, rather than just the beginning.
    With less labs, I would add in days where group projects could be worked on in person, common issues such as server
    configuration could be addressed by the professor, and where the professor walks students through just the initial
    setup for the project. At the beginning of the semester, software such as WinSCP (or Mac counterparts) and PuTTY
    could be introduced to those who have no experience with it.
    If labs consecutively build off of each other, the solution to the previous lab needs to be provided to make sure
    students are not failing three labs as a result of missing the first one.</p>
    <h3>Blogs:</h3><p>I would use blogs as a way to progressively add HTML teaching into the course. Since HTML is simpler and resources
    are easily found online, I would make blogs a less frequent homework assignment where students can use information
    from the textbook or online. The first blog post would be plain HTML and describe the process of setting up the
    server, the next one would add images and links, the next would add CSS styling or darkmode, and so on until course
    requirements are fulfilled. Instead of saying “go learn something new and write about it” these blog posts would
    have a specific objective that progressively get harder until basic HTML and CSS skills are learned. Making these
    more objective based and less frequent would allow for more focus on JavaScript in class while still retaining the
    HTML/CSS requirements.</p>
